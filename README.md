# 1. Important Information
Welcome to ASMNGS18! In the spirit of open science, we're trying to make this conference as **open, accessible, and user-friendly** as possible. This repo will store slides, posters, and notes from the conference from those participants who are up for sharing their material, and also serves as a mechanism to receive feedback in the form of issues (check [this out](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) if you're unsure how to create an issue). 

The [conference website](https://www.asm.org/index.php/asm-conference-on-next-generation-sequencing) contains all sorts of useful information, and if you're tweeting, please use the hashtag **#ASMNGS18**. You can tag **@ASMicrobiology** too.

If you need to get in touch with the organizers at any time, you have multiple options. You can tweet at the meeting chairs â€“ [@jennifergardy](http://www.twitter.com/jennifergardy) and [@dmaccannell](http://www.twitter.com/dmaccannell), you can email [Jennifer](mailto:jennifer.gardy@bccdc.ca) or [Duncan](mailto:fms2@cdc.gov), you can create an issue in this repo, or you can talk to our ASM Meetings team, including Latonya Trower and Tiffany Burns, at the Registration Desk.

# 2. Schedule & Presentations
We are encouraging speakers and poster presenters to make their materials available online. There are multiple avenues for doing so, including Google Drive, Slideshare, figshare,  F1000 Posters, and many more. The schedule below will be updated with links to slides as they are made available, and below the schedule is a list of posters that authors have placed online.

# 3. Code of Conduct
New for 2018 is our Code of Conduct, based on the Creative Commons Zero-licensed Code of Conduct from GitHub Events, portions of which are based on the example anti-harassment policy from the Geek Feminism wiki, created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers. The ASMNGS program committee is dedicated to providing a positive and harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, ethnicity, race, religion, nationality, or level of experience. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form, nor do we tolerate any behavior that would reasonably lead to another event participant being made to feel unsafe, insecure, or frightened for their physical or emotional well-being. All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience, including people of many different backgrounds.

Examples of encouraged behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for everyone at the event
- Showing empathy towards other participants

Unacceptable behavior includes:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, or inappropriate physical contact, sexual attention, or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, personal or political attacks, or sustained disruption of talks
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, or harassing photography or recording
- Harassment of any kind
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

**Thank you for helping to make this a welcoming, friendly space for all!**

# 4. Live Notes
At ASMNGS17, we started using the EtherPad platform for live, collaborative note-taking - the 2017 notes can be found [here](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/asmngs17). We're doing it again for ASMNGS18 - jump in and start taking notes at (https://tinyurl.com/asmngs18) and feel free to tweet the link so others can follow along from wherever they are. This Etherpad will stay up as long as Mozilla keeps that instance alive. We'll also archive a version to [figshare](http://www.figshare.com) after the meeting.

# 5. About ASMNGS18
ASMNGS began in 2015 (if you're feeling nostalgic, the program is available [here](https://www.asm.org/images/ngsfinalprogram.pdf)), organized by Dag Harmsen (University of Muenster), Marc Allard (FDA), and Eric Brown (FDA). In 2017, the program committee was co-chaired by Dag and Jennifer Gardy (BCCDC), and also included Marc, Eric, and new committee members Elodie Ghedin (NYU),  Paul Keim (TGen), Duncan MacCannell (CDC), Adam Phillippy (NHGRI). In order to both coincide with the GenomeTrakr annual meeting and to not conflict with ABPHM, the committee decided to move the meeting to even years beginning in 2018. This year's meeting has been co-chaired by Jennifer and Duncan, and Ruth Timme (FDA) replaced Eric Brown on the organizing committee. The pre-conference workshop was organized by Dag.

Keynote speakers were selected by soliciting ideas from the organizing committee, who then arrived at our top choices through an email discussion. Submitted abstracts were reviewed by Jennifer and Duncan - 194 were accepted, and 22 were declined. Reasons for declining abstracts included a topic not consistent with the conference's scope, or inadequate/inappropriate/insufficient methods/results/conclusions. All accepted abstracts were reviewed by the organizing committee, and six committee members cast votes for that they felt merited oral presentation. Votes were tallied, and abstracts selected for oral presentation accordingly. We also looked for diversity in our presenters, though we acknowledge gender diversity was hard to achieve in the Tools and Pipelines section. Travel awards  for trainees were also allocated using the committee's votes.

All program committee members have funded their own travel and registration costs for the meeting. Invited keynote speakers have been reimbursed according to ASM guidelines. All sponsorship money raised has gone towards the cost of hosting the meeting, including social events.
